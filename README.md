# MIMIC-IV_EDA
Exploratory data analysis is done on the MIMIC-IV Clinical Dataset Demo v2.2 dataset.

This project explores the MIMIC-IV Clinical Dataset Demo v2.2, a deidentified subset of ICU patient records from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Using R, the analysis covers:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): univariate and multivariate summaries across demographics, ICU stays, labs, and outcomes.
- Hypothesis Testing: examining associations between patient characteristics, clinical measures, and outcomes.
- Data Quality Checks: assessing completeness and quality of the clinical data.
- Visualization: clear plots and tables to highlight trends and relationships.

The project demonstrates how real-world EHR data can be prepared, analyzed, and interpreted for critical care research, while following reproducible coding practices.
